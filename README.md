<a id='intro'></a>
## Introduction

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

* `ScheduledDay` tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
* `Neighborhood` indicates the location of the hospital.
* `Scholarship` indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program [Bolsa Família](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia).
* The encoding of the last column says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
